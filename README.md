# Amazon Clone

![Amazon Clone Banner][amazon_clone_banner]

# I have built this clone using ReactJS.

### The clone looks so similar to the real app and has even better features! I like the way it feels. It has authetication built-in and even you can pay with real money although you won't get anything 🤣.

### Payment is handeled by Stripe and Firebase Cloud Functions!

### The hosting is handled using Firebase Hosting!

### The best part is that the project is open-sourced on GitHub! You can fork and create pull requests as you like!
